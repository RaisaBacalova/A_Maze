 ### Description of the Project
 A maze-garden located under the water. Mystic atmosphere caused by emptiness but, at the same time, by many sounds. 
 I created 2 keys, one of them is fake. If a player tries to open the door with it, it brings the player to the beginning of the game (scene reload)
 I also created a surreal water construction in the middle of the maze.
